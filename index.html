        <h3>My Story</h3>
            <h4>Past</h4>
                <p>I was born many moons ago in a small island in africa. Although I never 
                    met my real parents I grew up in a very loving bush with my adoptive 
                    parents. It wasnt until i first came in contact with other humans 
                    that i realized what my adoptive parents were, Apes!!</p>
            <h4>Present</h4>
                <p>Currently i spend my days screaming at the top of my lungs for 
                    no reason and playing with my friends. I recently met this girl, 
                    Jane, and although i dont know what are the sounds coming from her 
                    mouth she is so fine that I have to be around her. 
                    Her dad i dont really care about. </p>
            <h4>Future</h4>
                <p>I would love to venture out with Jane and see the world. 
                    Hopefully her dad doesnt come. I want to lear so much and 
                    see what is out there! Maybe i can find my real parens too. 
                    Finnally, I want to be a master Coder Like Patrick. Maybe 
                    have a cool hair bun too!</p>
